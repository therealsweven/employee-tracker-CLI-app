## Usage

The application may be accessed in the CLI of the computer by running npm run watch in the root directory of the app. The user will be instructed to choose an option from a list based on what they want to do with the database. Following the prompts, the user will give input and the app will make the necessary changes to the database through a mySQL connection. If the user inputs an incorrect data type, an error will be shown in the console. When an action has been successfully completed the user will see that the data has been successfully added/removed from the database. To quit the application, simply select the QUIT option in the main menu.
